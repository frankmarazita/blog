## Background

I've never felt that I have been great when it comes to writing, and to be quite honest, I've never really had the urge to sit down and write. Recently however I have found that I really wanted another creative outlet, nothing too crazy, and nothing that will become overwhelming and take up too much of my time, but will allow me to share interesting and useful things.

In this blog, I'll aim to keep things short and sweet, with a variety of topics that I hope will capture your interest. I'll share my thoughts on things that interested me, offer some tips and tricks that I've found helpful, or simply highlight something that made me smile during the week. Whatever the topic, I hope that you'll find something of value in these weekly posts.

As I embark on scratching this creative itch, I welcome all feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to share your thoughts with myself, as I'll be looking for ways to improve and make this blog more engaging. Thank you for joining me on this adventure!

## Exploring Reading Fiction

I regrettably have not picked up a fiction book since high school, always finding myself consistently reading or listening to non-fiction books or audiobooks. Part of me has subconsciously found reading non-fiction a lot more accessible and allows for a more flexible reading schedule. Since almost all of the non-fiction I read is not story based, the content lends itself to act as more or a guide where the order of chapters isn't necessarily crucial, and swapping between multiple books often seems reasonable.

Okay, so I am not going to give up reading non-fiction that easy but I have recently been inspired to start introducing fiction into my readings. At the start of the year this idea was bought to my attention by Lex Fridman where he is [reading a fiction book every week this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/lexfridman/comments/10045g8/book_reading_list_for_2023_post_from_lex/). I am not planning on adopting the same schedule but to go at my own pace and choose titles which I feel best align with my interests. He is also trying to read almost exclusively well respected classics, I feel I will try do the same.

I'm going in blind and starting off with *Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams. I have heard bits and pieces about this book, but don't really know much about it other than it's considered as a love letter to science fiction. Another reason for the pick was that it's considered to be quite a short read and if I want this to eventually become a habit, it needs to start off being a reasonably achievable goal (my personal approach to new things).

## Quote I'm Pondering

> "At a certain point you stop being judged on your technical skills and start being judged on how you work with people."

I was listening to a podcast episode featuring the creator of ESLint (a software dev tool ðŸ˜´) and they were discussing career progression for developers towards the end. The quote was pulled by the interviewer from the creator's [personal website](https://humanwhocodes.com/coaching/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAt%20a%20certain%20point%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9Cyou%20stop%20being%20judged%20on%20your%20technical%20skills%20and%20start%20being%20judged%20on%20how%20you%20work%20with%20people.%E2%80%9D).

I felt this quote resinated with me and I paused to think it through for a second. For those that are in technical roles it's important to try and constantly remind ourselves that as we desire to excel in our careers, there is usually a significant interpersonal expectation also.

A link to the podcast can be found [here](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkLnN5bnRheC5mbS9yc3M/episode/NDJhMGEyZGMtOTk4YS00N2ZmLTgxYjktOGQ4YjBkNGJkOTdh?ep=14) for those interested, just keep in mind that the context is quite technical.
