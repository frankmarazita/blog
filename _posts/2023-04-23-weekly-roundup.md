## Background

I've never felt that I have been great when it comes to writing, and to be quite honest, I've never really had the though to sit down and write. Recently I have found that I really wanted another creative outlet, nothing too crazy, and nothing that will become overwhelming and take up too much of my time, but will allow me to share some interesting and useful things with you.

In this blog, I'll aim to keep things short and sweet, with a variety of topics that I hope will capture your interest. I'll share my thoughts on things that interested me, offer some tips and tricks that I've found helpful, or simply highlight something that made me smile during the week. Whatever the topic, I hope that you'll find something of value in my weekly posts.

As I embark on scratching this creative itch, I welcome all feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to share your thoughts with myself, as I'll be looking for ways to improve and make this blog more engaging. Thank you for joining me on this adventure!
